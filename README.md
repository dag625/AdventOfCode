# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions

This project contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 challenges
in C++.  For details about these challenges see the
[Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com).

The usage of the built application is:

```shell script
AdventOfCode2020 <Path to Input Directory> [<Day> [<Challenge>]]
```

The input directory is the "inputs" directory in the source tree
and it contains the inputs provided in the challenges.  The 'Day'
and 'Challenge' parameters are optional and will limit the challenges
run to the given day and challenge part (there are typically two
challenges each day).

The output of the application will be as follows:

```
Day A - Challenge X
<Output for Challenge X on Day A>
Day B - Challenge Y
<Output for Challenge Y on Day B>
Day C - Challenge Z
<Output for Challenge Z on Day C>
```
