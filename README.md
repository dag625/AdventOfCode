# Advent of Code Solutions

This project contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges
in C++.  I have started with the 2020 challenges but I may eventually
go back and do challenges for earlier years.  For details about these 
challenges see the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com).

The usage of the built application is:

```shell script
AdventOfCode <Path to Input Directory> [<Year> [<Day> [<Challenge>]]]
```

The input directory is the "inputs" directory in the source tree
and it contains the inputs provided in the challenges.  The 'Year', 
'Day', and 'Challenge' parameters are optional and will limit the challenges
run to the given day and challenge part (there are typically two
challenges each day).

The output of the application will be as follows:

```
Year 20NN - Day A - Challenge X
<Output for Challenge X on Day A from Year 20NN>
Year 20NN - Day B - Challenge Y
<Output for Challenge Y on Day B from Year 20NN>
Year 20NN - Day C - Challenge Z
<Output for Challenge Z on Day C from Year 20NN>
```
